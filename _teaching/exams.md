#### Exams:
We will have 2 in-class exams, the dates of which are posted on the homepage. The exam questions will be based off of the reading and homework. These exams will be non-cumulative, and will be open-book/open-notes, but no calculators are allowed.

#### Final exam:
During the regularly-scheduled exam period (Sat. Dec. 8th 2018, 8:00 AM-11:00 AM). This will be cumulative, and will be more heavily weighted to new material. The final exam is also open-book/open-notes, with no calculators allowed.

Make up for tests will be given only under extreme circumstances. You must notify me immediately if you are not able to take a test at the scheduled time.
