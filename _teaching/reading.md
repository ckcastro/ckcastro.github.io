As described in the syllabus, you are expected to read each section prior to each class. The reading assignments are listed below. 

<i>Note:</i> All dates further than one week in advance are tentative, and may be changed without notice. 

For warm-up problems:

* Pay attention to the due dates, some warm-up assignments involve two sections. 

* You must show your work (as applicable) to receive credit. 

* You may work with others on these warm-up assignments. 

* You must turn these in yourself, on paper, at the beginning of class, on the assigned date.
