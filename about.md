I am an Adjunct Lecturer at the Department of Mathematics at Southern Methodist University in Dallas TX. Beginning Spring semester 2019, I will join the [University of Nevada at Reno](https://www.unr.edu/math) as an Teaching Postdoc. 
I was awarded my PhD in Computational and Applied Mathematics from [SMU](https://www.smu.edu/dedman/academics/departments/math), working with Alejandro B. Aceves. I was a graduate research assistant at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Center for Nonlinear Studies. After graduation, I held an appointment as a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Metamaterials and Plasmonics Research Group](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~aalu/), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin.


### Acknowledgements
I utilized my own HTML templates, but had no prior knowledge of liquid nor the required Jekyll system file format. I took [Michael Rose](http://twitter.com/mmistakes)'s theme [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Having a prebuilt archive and the YAML front-matter already set up was a great help.
