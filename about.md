I am a postdoctoral fellow at University of Texas at Austin.

### Features
* flexible, uses max-width for responsive goodness
* responsive drop down menu


### Acknowledgements
I utilized my own HTML templates, but had no prior knowledge of liquid nor the required Jekyll system file format. I took [Michael Rose](http://twitter.com/mmistakes)'s theme [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Having a prebuilt archive and the YAML front-matter already set up was a great help.
