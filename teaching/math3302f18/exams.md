## Exams:
We will have 2 in-class exams, the dates of which are posted on the homepage. The exam questions will be based off of the reading and homework. These exams will be non-cumulative, and will be open-book/open-notes, but no calculators are allowed.

## Final exam:
During the [regularly-scheduled exam period](https://www.smu.edu/EnrollmentServices/Registrar/Enrollment/FinalExamSchedule/Fall2018). This will be cumulative, and will be more heavily weighted to new material. The final exam is also open-book/open-notes, with no calculators allowed.

## Make-up Policy:
Make up for tests will be given only under extreme circumstances. You must notify me immediately if you are not able to take a test at the scheduled time.
